        <h1>Literally My Favorite Things in the World</h1>

        <h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
        <p>
            I have been rock climbing since I was about ten years old.
            I love rock climbing because it is a very good workout and keeps me fit, and it's also just very fun. 
            There is no feeling more satisfying than sending a hard climb that you have been working at for a while.
            I sport climb and lead climb both in a gym and outdoors. 
            I also boulder, but I don't like it quite as much as I love sport climbing.
        </p>

        <h2>Drawing and Art</h2>
        <p> 
            Never said I'm good at it, but I love it anyway.
            My mom is a professional painter; she sells her oil, watercolor and acrylic paintings in various art galleries across Utah.
            She is where I get my inspiration for drawing and painting. 
            My favorite art forms are drawing cartoon characters and also doing acrylic pour paintings.

        <h2>Eating Pasta</h2>
        <p>
            I don't really know why I love it so much, I just really love pasta. I'm not even picky about the type of pasta. I just love all pastas. Lasagna is probably my favorite pasta, but not by much.
            And of course if I am eating pasta, there must be garlic bread to go with it (I love that stuff almost as much as I love pasta)
        </p>
        <!--put in picture of me chrocheting my scarf or something-->
        <h2>Knitting and Crocheting</h2>
        <p> 
            It makes me seem older than I am (which could be a bad thing or a good thing, I'm not quite sure), but I love it anyway. 
            I make scarves, blankets, and sweaters, as well as some other random things like stuffed cactuses and mice.
            Never trust me in a yarn store with a credit card. Last time I was left alone in this situation I left with almost $300 of yarn...

        <h2>Reading and Writing</h2>
        <p>
            As much as I love computer programming, I have never been one to spend copious ammounts of time surfing the web.
            I much prefer curling up on the coutch with a good book and a nice cup of tea. In addition to reading stories, I
            write my own stories, mostly short stories although I am currently working on a longer book.
