        <h1>Hi! I'm <strong>Rose Robrecht</strong> =)</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my website. If you want to know a little bit more about me, <strong>you've come to the right place</strong>
            I'm a fun-loving, red-headed little devil who loves math and <q>hates hapiness</q>, or at least that's what
            the admissions councelor at the University of Utah told me. <br><br>
            The presence of fellow humans stresses me out, to <em>no end</em>, which I'm blaming on my social anxiety, but I love you all anyway!
            I always want new friends, so please come give me platonic affection. Thank's in advance, and have fun with this little site!
        </p>
