        <!--I want a picture of the U's logo-->
        <p>In the future, I want to go to University of Utah, and double major in Mathmatics and 
            Computer Science. I want to graduate and get a job in probably either math teaching or web 
            development (or some other discreat programming job that I decide I like). I also want to have
            a family and maybe some kids (or maybe not, cause they seem like a huge pain in the butt) but 
            that is something that I definitely wouldn't want to do that until after I finish my schooling
            and have a stable job.
