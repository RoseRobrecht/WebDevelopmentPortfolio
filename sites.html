        <!-- I want a link that shows up as a gif of something about reddit-->
        <p>I love reddit cause it is just really funny. I honestly just use it for the memes. Whenever I
            wanna scroll some dank memes, I just go to reddit on my phone. I also occasionally use it for
            the pretty nature pictures that I can find on some subreddits, and also TopTalent subreddits 
            that show people doing really cool things. Idiots in cars is also a favorite of mine.

        <h4>I don't reliably use any other websites.... I guess I'm pretty boring. I prefer books to browsing the internet</h4>
