                <p>I love reddit cause it is just really funny. I honestly just use it for the memes. Whenever I
                    wanna scroll some dank memes, I just go to reddit on my phone. I also occasionally use it for
                    the pretty nature pictures that I can find on some subreddits, and also TopTalent subreddits 
                    that show people doing really cool things. Idiots in cars is also a favorite of mine.

                    Pinterest is where I go when I am bored and looking for a fun project. I use it mainly for art inspiration
                    and for craft ideas. I think it's formatted sort of badly, so I don't spend a lot of time on here, but I do like to use it once in a while.
